            As an impressively muscled warrior in the service of the fell wizard Saruman, you're in constant
            need of replenishing nutrients to fuel your body, which in turn fuels 
            the terrible war machine of the Dark Lord. But not just any old muck will do, for
            you are no rabble of mindless orcs; your armor is thick and your shields are broad. And so is your appetite!
            Fortunately, there exist no less than one, maybe even two tolerable to okay recipes
            that will satiate the refined palate of the Uruk warrior.
